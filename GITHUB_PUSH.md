# GitHub Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push your repository to GitHub:

1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Give your repository a name (e.g., "gemma-finetuning")
   - Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (you already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal (from the project directory):

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace 'your-username' and 'your-repo-name' with actual values)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your repository should now be on GitHub with all the code and files.
