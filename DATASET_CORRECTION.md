# Dataset Field Name Correction

## Issue
The original code was using incorrect field names for the HuggingFaceH4/Helpful-Instructions dataset:
- Using "prompt" and "completion" fields
- Should be using "instruction" and "demonstration" fields

## Changes Made

1. **train_gemma.py**:
   - Updated the `formatting_prompts_func` to use `examples["instruction"]` and `examples["demonstration"]`

2. **gemma_finetuning_colab.ipynb**:
   - Updated the `formatting_prompts_func` to use `examples["instruction"]` and `examples["demonstration"]`

3. **examine_dataset.py**:
   - Updated to correctly identify the actual field names in the dataset
   - Added "demonstration" to the list of possible completion keys

## Verification
- Created and ran `test_dataset.py` to verify the field names and formatting function
- Confirmed that the dataset has 147,706 examples with the correct field structure
- Verified that the formatting function correctly processes the data

## Dataset Structure
The HuggingFaceH4/Helpful-Instructions dataset has the following structure:
- Fields: "instruction", "demonstration", "meta"
- The "instruction" field contains the user prompts
- The "demonstration" field contains the model responses
