# Gemma 3 270M Fine-tuning Project - Final Summary

## Project Status
The Gemma 3 270M fine-tuning project has been successfully created and all necessary corrections have been made.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Complete Project Structure**:
   - Created a dedicated "fine-tune-gemma" folder with all project files
   - Organized files into logical groups (training scripts, evaluation tools, utilities, etc.)

2. **Dataset Correction**:
   - Identified and fixed incorrect field names in the HuggingFaceH4/Helpful-Instructions dataset
   - Updated all relevant scripts to use "instruction" and "demonstration" fields instead of "prompt" and "completion"
   - Verified the correction with a test script

3. **Multiple Implementation Options**:
   - Google Colab notebook optimized for T4 GPU
   - Local training script with configuration support
   - Cross-platform deployment scripts (Windows, Linux, macOS)

4. **Comprehensive Tooling**:
   - Training scripts with LoRA fine-tuning
   - Model evaluation and comparison tools
   - Environment checking utilities
   - Training metrics visualization
   - Project packaging script

5. **Documentation**:
   - Detailed README with usage instructions
   - File summaries and completion reports
   - Dataset correction documentation

## Files in the Project

All files are now located in the "fine-tune-gemma" folder:
- Training: `train_gemma.py`, `gemma_finetuning_colab.ipynb`, `config.json`
- Evaluation: `evaluate_model.py`, `compare_models.py`
- Utilities: `check_env.py`, `visualize_training.py`, `test_dataset.py`
- Deployment: `run_training.sh`, `run_training.bat`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `FILE_SUMMARY.md`, `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`, `DATASET_CORRECTION.md`
- Supporting: `requirements.txt`, `training_logs.json`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. For Google Colab: Upload `gemma_finetuning_colab.ipynb` and run with T4 GPU
3. For local training: Run `python train_gemma.py`
4. For evaluation: Use `evaluate_model.py` and `compare_models.py`

The project is now ready for fine-tuning the `unsloth/gemma-3-270m-it` model with the HuggingFaceH4/Helpful-Instructions dataset.
